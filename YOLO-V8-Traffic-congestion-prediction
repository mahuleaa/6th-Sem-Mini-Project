In this project, we leverage the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 algorithm. YOLOv8 is known for its efficiency and accuracy in object detection tasks, making it particularly well-suited for real-time applications. Our focus is on detecting both trucks and cars in a dynamic traffic environment, providing an understanding of vehicle movement patterns.
