Emergency-Vehicle-Detection
A image detection model that is used to differentiate between regular vehicles and emergency vehicles.

Model is developed using the Inception-v3 model weights. Custom output layers are trained on the images, by freezing the pre-trained weights. Validation accuracy of ~95% is achieved.
